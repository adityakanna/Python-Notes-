-> Function(): 1. Set of statements which are used to perform specific operation o variable are called
               as function.
               2. we can declare function by using 'def' Keyword.
'''

'''
They are 2 types of functions: 
1. Pre-define Function: a. If function are already available then we will called as Pre - defined function.
   b. To Execute function Logic we need to call function by using function name.
Ex: print(), Input(), type(), min(), max(),....
'''
# 1. a = '5'
#    print(type(a))

# 2. a = [5, 10, 25, 8, 3, 15]
#    print('Total no.of Element are',len(a)]
#    print('Sum of Element are',sum(a)]
#    print('Smallest of Element are',min(a)]
#    print('Larger of Element are',max(a)]

'''
2. User - define Function: a. Based on application requirments if you create any function then it is called
                           as user - define function.
b. For user - define Function, we have to perform 2 things:-
   1. Declare Function by using ('def') keyword.
   2. Call Function by using function name.
'''
# Syntax to Declare a Function :-
# Ex1: def Show()
#         print('Hai')
#      print('Thank you')
#      show()
# Output: Hai
#         Thank you

# Ex2: def show()
#         print('Hai')
#      print('Thank You')
#      show()
# Output: Thank You
#         Hai

# Ex3: def withdraw()
#          print('Hai')
#      def balEnq()
#          print('Hello')
#      withdraw()
# Output: Hai

'''
Functions with Parameters: 
1. If you have parameters than at the time of calling function we need to pass value
Ex: def Login (Uname, pwd)
        print(Uname)
        print(pwd)
    Login('Venkat','A123a')
Ex: def converstion(n)
         D = Float(input('Enter the One Doller into Rupees')
         C = n/D
         print(c)
    a = Float(input('Enter the Amount Value'))
    converstion(a)
