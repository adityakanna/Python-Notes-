-> Variable :-
   Variable are used to store value. Variable names are the name given to memory location is called
   variable names.
   Ex: a = 10 -- Where, given 'a' is a variable name. And 10 is a value
   We can store the value by using Assignment operator( = ). Assignment operator (=) is called as Right or Left
   operator.
'''

'''
Note: In one variable we can store only one value at a time. In case, Second values comes then first value is 
      been deleted.
Ex: a = 5
    a = 7
    print(a)
'''

'''
Syntax 1: variable name   =    value   
             (Left)           (Right)
'''
# Ex: a = 5, b = 2.5, Ename =   'Aditya'

'''
Syntax 2: variable name   =    Value / Operand / Expression 
             (Left)                      (Right)
'''
# Ex: a = 5 , b = a , c = p. Where, C return Error. Because, We don't have any memory Location with name 'P'.

'''
-> Swapping:- Interchange the value are called Swapping 
Ex: a = 5, b = 3 
'''
# Note: We can declare more than one variable at one at a time.

# Syntax = variable1, variable2,......... = value1, value2,........... and the number of variable and value
#          should be Equal.

# Ex: a = 5, b = 7 (or) a,b = 5,7
# Ex: a,b,c = 3,9 -> (Error)


'''
-> Print() Function:- 
1. Print function ia used to display the data. In print function inside of single (or) double quotes what even 
   we wrote same they we will gets as a output.
'''
# Ex1: print('Hello, World')     |     print('Hai')
#      Output: Hello, World      |     Output: Hai

# Ex2: a = 5            |   print('2 + 3')
#      print('a')       |   output: 2 + 3
#      output: a        |

'''
2. If you want to perform operation then write without Single (or) Double Quotes.
'''

# Ex1: print(2 + 3)      |   a = 5                           |   P = 6
#      Output: 5         |   print(a)                        |   Q = 3
#                        |   Output: 5                       |   R = P + Q
#                        |   print('Your value is:', a)      |   Output: print('Sum is:',R)
#                                                            |           print(R,'is your Result')
#                                                            |           print(p,'and',Q' is sum ', R)

# Ex2: D = 20
#     print('Discount is',D,'%')
